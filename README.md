# Capstone Project: 
# RedMusic - A Music Recommendation Web App
The proposed music recommendation system is a music player web application which features providing personalized music content to users based on user listening histories and on meta-data about the music. The user will be able to create an account and sign in, stream music content, rate each song as “like” or “dislike”, view his/her listening histories and get personalized recommendations according to his/her own preferences.
